        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Here’s a straightforward chocolate cake recipe perfect for beginners and seasoned bakers alike. Combine 1¾ cups all-purpose flour, ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 cups granulated sugar, 1½ teaspoons baking powder, 1½ teaspoons baking soda, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl, then whisk in 2 large eggs, 1 cup whole milk, ½ cup vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract until smooth. Add 1 cup boiling water to create a thin batter, pour it into two greased 9-inch round pans, and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 30-35 minutes—done when a toothpick comes out clean. After cooling, frost with your choice of chocolate or vanilla frosting for a rich, moist cake that’s simple yet satisfying.

            <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup boiling water</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 cups granulated sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda, and 1 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Add 2 large eggs, 1 cup whole milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract to the dry ingredients, mixing until fully combined and smooth.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1 cup boiling water to thin the batter—it will be runny, but that’s normal.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, frost with your favorite chocolate or vanilla frosting and serve.</li>
